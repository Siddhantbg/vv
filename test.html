            <p class="anim1">Hi Deb Whatsup. This is your friendly neighbourhood SpiderMan. Oh and hey can you please press up or down arrow keys for me please. Yeah the music would make things interesting. Whenever you go on to any of the pages press the up or down arrow key to play the music and enjoy the Deb-Verse. I along with other super-heros will be guiding you throughout the multiverse which your Sid (believe me I was forced to say these particular 2 words) has named Deb-Verse. And Siddhant couldn't come up because he's ins't supposed to show his pathetic face to you. I dunno but something might have happened but I'll leave it upto you two to sort it out. So he has forced...I mean requested us to do his job. And please do checkout every detail of it. He has been working on this since a long time now. So yeah come on and stay right behind me you might get lost in this multi-verse.</p>

            <p class="anim4">This Day you grabbed his collar because he said if you wanted to go and you give valid reasons. He will let you go. And you became angry and grabbed him by collar super tight. He asked me not to say to you but you are much stronger than him. The first time you hugged him, he said he could feel his bones crack. He likes the day you two met the most. He describes it as you two were sitting on the last bench in BEEE class. And you two started talking. U wore a red kurti with patiyala that day. By that uk he regrets that you changed your clothing style because of him. He says he had no idea u were doing that until u told him. Its among one of the things he is guilty of. Well ya he thanks you for teaching him so much of how to behave and be. He has learnt a lot and is becoming a better person now. And would continue to do so. He mentions he likes your singing very much. Well check out the gallery below. Its a soft copy photo book, he wanted to give a hard copy but since you told him no and considering how things have ended now, so it would not be rightous to hand it to you now.  </p>
